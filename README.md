## Plugin Features

The APPROVE Woocommerce integration plugin provides a methodology for Wordpress developers to add the APPROVE lender network finance rates, lease cart, and lease application functionality into Woocommerce product pages and cart. 

Each Woocommerce cart implementation is unique to each site, so instead of providing a single solution that may not work for your site, we addressed the crux of the problem and created resources for Wordpress developers. Users of the APPROVE Woocommerce integration plugin will be able to customize its look and location as needed by the site.
