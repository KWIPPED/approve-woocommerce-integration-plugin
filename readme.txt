Provides the necessary structure to retrieve and use KWIPPED APPROVE lender network rates and other information.

== Description ==

The APPROVE Woocommerce integration plugin provides a methodology for Wordpress developers to add the APPROVE 
lender network finance rates, lease cart, and lease application functionality into Woocommerce product pages and cart. 

Each Woocommerce cart implementation is unique to each site, so instead of providing a single solution that may not work for 
your site, we addressed the crux of the problem and created resources for Wordpress developers. Users of the APPROVE Woocommerce 
integration plugin will be able to customize its look and location as needed by the site.
